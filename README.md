# AFRICANA - Unsplash, for the African culture!

![africana](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62969791/171306218-b79468e3-b773-4721-a9aa-c4567e8ae74e.png)


## Overview
Over the years, creatives (designers, videographers, web developers, etc) have been experiencing difficulty in accessing quality and high definition local stock photos relative to our (African) culture and heritage. While indigenous photographers who have these photos lack platforms to display their work. Africana is poised as a link to solve the above mentioned challenges. Our platform will allow photographers to upload photos which will then be curated by a team of photo editors and then provide a public API (application programming interface) that will answer to billion African photo requests per month. When the user interacts with the website, we desire for a seamless experience, hence a satisfied reaction from the user. The user should be able to sign up or sign in with as little steps as possible and easy to navigate. 


## What is required of you to know or have
This Solution was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org) on the frontend and [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)  at the Backend. Hence, it is very important that you know the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org). 
Tools used include a Github repository – this would require that you create an account on Github; a Text editor preferably VS Code and Git – this would require that you download and install on your local machine.
